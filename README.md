## An Interesting Read about Software Engineering - Milan Engineer

### Article: [The New York Times Games’ Path to Dark Mode](https://open.nytimes.com/the-new-york-times-games-path-to-dark-mode-345dfe464e1a)

I found this article interesting as I frequently play the NYT Games and did not realize that implementing dark mode would be such a complicated task. At first, I would think the developers would just need to invert the colors of the background and make a few small changes to some of the colors. However, as many of their colors are tied to their brand, it is not as simple as this.

Furthermore, it was interesting to see how the software development processes we learn about in class are applied in the real world. These include design diagrams, Agile development, and technologies such as React and CSS. Finally, I appreciated how the article highlighted the impact of developing new features for users, while also demonstrating how these features benefit the business as a whole. Hopefully this example can demonstrate to other companies the importance of working with their users to improve their product.
